The task
You again live in your own branch, this time we will be doing a bit of juggling with branches, to show how lightweight branches are in git.

Create a branch called greeting and switch to it
Edit the greeting.txt to contain your favorite greeting
Add greeting.txt files to the staging area
Commit
Switch back to the master branch
Create a file README.md with information about this repository
Add the README.md file to staging area and make the commit
What is the output of git log --oneline --graph --all?
Diff the branches
Merge the greeting branch into master
What is the output of git log --oneline --graph --all now? Observe the extra merge commit created with the message "Merge branch 'greeting'".
